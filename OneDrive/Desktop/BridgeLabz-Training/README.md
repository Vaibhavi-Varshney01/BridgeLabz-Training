📅 Day 1 – LeetCode and GCR Practice (C#)



📌 Overview



Today marks Day 1 of my C# practice journey, covering both LeetCode-style problem solving and GCR codebase work. The focus was on understanding core programming logic, writing clean and readable code, practicing fundamental array and string problems, and organizing the project structure properly using Git and GitHub.



All programs were implemented with a clear approach, proper variable naming, and logical flow to make the code exam-ready and easy to understand.



✅ LeetCode Problems Covered Today



1️⃣ Palindrome Number



Checked whether a given number reads the same forward and backward

Implemented using a while loop

Used mathematical logic such as modulus and division



Concepts Used:



Loops

Number manipulation

Conditional statements



2️⃣ Two Sum



Found two elements in an array whose sum equals a given target value

Used a brute-force approach with nested loops



Concepts Used:



Arrays

Nested loops

Time complexity understanding



3️⃣ Reverse Array



Reversed an array in-place without using any extra array

Used the two-pointer technique



Concepts Used:



Arrays

Swapping logic

While loop



4️⃣ Valid Anagram



Checked whether two strings are anagrams of each other

Used character frequency counting instead of sorting



Concepts Used:



Strings

Arrays (frequency array)

Character manipulation



5️⃣ Remove Element



Removed all occurrences of a given value from an array

Modified the array in-place and calculated the new length



Concepts Used:



Arrays

Two-pointer technique

In-place operations



📁 GCR Codebase Work



Created and organized the GCR folder structure for C# practice

Created a separate leet-code-codebase folder to store LeetCode programs

Moved all solved C# programs into appropriate folders

Maintained proper naming conventions for files and folders

Ensured a clean, structured, and scalable project hierarchy



🔧 Git and GitHub Work



Worked on the core-csharp-practise branch

Practiced Git commands such as status, add, commit, and push

Learned how to handle file path errors and verify file locations before staging

Successfully pushed code and documentation to the GitHub repository



🛠 Tools \& Technologies



Language: C#

IDE: VS Code and Notepad

Version Control: Git and GitHub

Environment: Git Bash

Practice Style: LeetCode problems and GCR structured practice



🎯 Learning Outcome



Improved understanding of basic DSA and logic-building problems
